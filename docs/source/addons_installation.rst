Should I Get the Legacy Variant or the Extension Variant?
------------
Starting in Blender 4.2, extensions are the new way of doing add-ons and themes. Legacy add-ons are considered deprecated but continue to be supported.

See here: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.2/advanced/extensions/addons.html#legacy-vs-extension-add-ons

CG Meerkat’s add-ons’ features do not differ between their legacy and extension variants.

Extension Installation
------------

To install extensions, go to Preferences, click "Get Extensions" in the sidebar, click the "Install from Disk" item in the dropdown menu at the top right, and select the add-on’s .zip file.

Or drag-and-drop an extension .zip package into Blender.

Legacy Add-on Installation
----------------

To install legacy add-ons, go to Preferences, click "Add-ons" in the sidebar, click the "Install from Disk" item in the dropdown menu at the top right, and select the add-on’s .zip file.
